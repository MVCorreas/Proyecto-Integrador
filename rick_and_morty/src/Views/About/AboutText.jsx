        <AboutP>
        <p>I am Victoria, or just Maria, as some of you may call me after my first name. I am an English teacher. So... "What am I doing here today" you may ask. Sure, I have decided to make a little (or huge) change in my life. </p>
        <p>Some motnhs ago, a close friend of my mentioned I would very much like to study programming. Study what? Yes, I had no clue what programming was. As fas as I knew, a programmer was a geek that sat in front of his computer (and I say "his" intentionally), day after day, and night after night, in a dark, damp room. No contacts with the outer world. Did I want that?</p>
        <p>Why not? As I said before, I wanted a change. How bad could that be? But what exactly IS programming?</p>
        <p>That is when I decided to enrol on a programming course from scracth. I immediately fell in love. That love drove me to HENRY and to where I am today: my very first steps into a newer universe.</p>
        <p>Hope you enjoy what I have done with this app!</p>
